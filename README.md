Since I used vue.js vuex and quasar for the front end, I only pushed the backend (laravel api, migration, and seeder).
This is how it's looks like:

Laravel runing on localhost:8000
Vue.js  running on localhost:8086
The sample for the alarms and the devices are generated by seeder class = DevicesSeeder.php
     //100 random devices for each one, an other 100 random alarms 
     Device::factory()->count(100)->create()->each(function ($device) {
            $device->alarms()->saveMany(Alarm::factory()->count(100)->make());
        });
